[![CI](https://github.com/gina-io/swig/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gina-io/swig/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@rhinostone/swig.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig) [![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@rhinostone/swig.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig) [![Socket Badge](https://socket.dev/api/badge/npm/package/@rhinostone/swig)](https://socket.dev/npm/package/@rhinostone/swig)

> **Multi-flavor template engine** for Node.js and browsers — native Swig syntax (Jinja2/Django-inspired), Twig syntax, Python Jinja2 syntax, and Django Template Language syntax via dedicated frontends sharing one IR backend. [gina-io/swig](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) started as a maintained continuation of the abandoned `paularmstrong/swig` (last released 2014) and is now a standalone project. Security and bug fixes ship here.

> **Part of the [Gina](https://github.com/gina-io/gina) ecosystem.** This is the built-in template engine for [Gina](https://gina.io) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gina)), a Node.js MVC framework with HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation.

Swig is a **Jinja2/Django-inspired** template engine for node.js and browsers. The syntax will feel familiar to Jinja2 and Django users, but Swig is **not drop-in compatible** with either — porting templates from an existing project requires a handful of changes. See the [Migration Guide](https://gina.io/docs/templating/swig/migration) for the full parity list and workaround patterns.

> **Coming from Twig?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig) instead — a dedicated Twig-syntax frontend with closer parity than working around incompatibilities here.

> **Coming from Python Jinja2?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2) — a dedicated Jinja2-syntax frontend (near-subset) with closer parity than porting to native Swig syntax here.

> **Coming from Django?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django) — a dedicated Django Template Language frontend that renders real Django templates, with far closer parity than native Swig syntax here.

Features
--------

* Available for node.js **and** major web browsers.
* **Strict-CSP browser runtime** — AOT-compile templates ahead of time (`swig compile --recursive --register`) and render them with the runtime-only bundle (`dist/swig.runtime.min.js`, ~22 KB) — no parser, no `new Function`, no `unsafe-eval` required.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) compatible.
* **Async template loading** — back the loader with S3 / Redis / HTTP / any callback API: set `loader.async = true` and pass a callback to `renderFile`, or to `compileFile` with `codegenMode: 'async'` in its options, whose compiled function returns a promise of `{ output, exports }`; `extends` / `include` / `import` resolve at render time, dynamic `{% extends %}` paths included.
* Object-Oriented template inheritance.
* Apply filters and transformations to output in your templates.
* **Security-hardened** — prototype-pollution vectors (`__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype`) blocked at parser, tag-side, and IR-emission layers; template-driven file reads outside the loader root rejected (CVE-2023-25345 directory traversal, patched in 2.7.1). Dedicated CVE regression suite in [`tests/regressions.test.js`](./tests/regressions.test.js).
* Automatically escapes all variable output (HTML by default; configurable per-call).
* Lots of iteration and conditionals supported.
* Robust without the bloat — a single runtime dependency ([`@rhinostone/swig-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core)).
* Extendable and customizable — register custom filters, tags, and loaders per-instance.

What's new in v2.8.2
--------------------

> **Upgrade if a template takes a `wordwrap` width or a range bound from request data.** swig-jinja2's `wordwrap` hung on a width below 1 and swig-twig's `a..b` on an infinite bound, which plain JSON produces for a number such as `1e999`; each took seconds and more than 2 GB of memory before failing.

> **Error text changed.** The prototype-chain guards' messages end with `(prototype-chain guard)` instead of `(CVE-2023-25345)`; code that matches the old text has to match the new one.

* **Security — swig-jinja2 `wordwrap` no longer hangs on a width below 1.** A width of 0 or less, as a number or as a string such as `"0"`, ran for four to six seconds and took more than 2 GB of memory before a RangeError; it now returns the input unchanged (Jinja2 raises). A width between 0 and 1 now breaks one character at a time, as Python does. Every swig-jinja2 release since 2.5.0 has the hang.
* **Security — swig-twig ranges no longer hang on an infinite bound.** `a..b` with a bound of Infinity looped until the array overflowed, taking up to about three seconds and more than 2 GB of memory before a RangeError; the range is now empty, as it already was for NaN. Every release since 2.0.0-alpha.5 has the hang.
* **Fixed — parenthesized sub-expressions keep their grouping, in every flavor.** Since 2.0.0-alpha.2 a group whose operator binds more loosely than the operator outside it was evaluated wrongly (`{{ (1 + 2) * 3 }}` rendered 7, and `{% if (x or y) and z %}` took its branch with x true and z false), as were a comparison grouped inside a comparison and a subscript on a `+` group, and `{{ -(-x) }}` failed to compile. Groups that JavaScript reads the same way, `not (…)`, `-(…)` and a group followed by a filter were not affected.
* **Fixed — swig-jinja2 expressions follow Jinja2's precedence.** A unary minus applies before the filters and the `**` that follow it (`-2 ** 2` is 4); `**` reads from the left (`2 ** 3 ** 2` is 64); a test binds to the operand next to it (`{{ 1 + 2 is number }}` tests 2, and `not x is defined` negates the test) and takes one argument without parentheses (`x is divisibleby 3`); and `not` sits below the comparisons and arithmetic (`not x == y` is `not (x == y)`).
* **Fixed — swig-jinja2 tests.** `lower` and `upper` need a cased letter, `odd` follows Python's `n % 2 == 1`, and `number` accepts NaN, as in Jinja2.
* **Fixed — swig-jinja2 filters follow Jinja2.** `first`, `last`, `reverse`, `unique`, `min`, `max` and `slice` use a mapping's keys; `batch` starts a row at exactly `size` items and batches a string by its characters; `sort` of a string returns its sorted characters; `replace` converts a number first and handles an empty search string and a negative count as Python does; `format` prints `%e` with at least two exponent digits and `%g` as Python does; and `wordwrap` keeps the separating space when a line is exactly full.
* **Fixed — swig-django filters follow Django.** `join` joins a string's characters and a mapping's keys; `pluralize` reads a boolean, a string and a mapping as Django does; `truncatechars` and `truncatewords` return the empty string for a count of 0 or less and the value unchanged for a count that Python's `int()` rejects.
* **Fixed — the shared engine, in all four frontends.** An async-mode compile no longer shares its cache entry with a sync compile of the same file (a sync include of such a file rendered `[object Promise]`); an error raised while a template compiles is reported when no options object is passed, instead of a TypeError, and names its file once; and the `varControls`, `tagControls` and `cmtControls` options reject a control that is not a string, with the open and close controls named the right way round.
* **Fixed — guard messages and version exports.** The prototype-chain guards' messages end with `(prototype-chain guard)`, and `swig-core`, `swig-twig`, `swig-jinja2` and `swig-django` export their `version`, as `swig` always has.
* **Fixed — documentation.** SECURITY.md names 2.8.x as the supported line; the issue and pull-request templates no longer open with the original project's "no longer maintained" notice; and the README says that `compileFile` needs `codegenMode: 'async'` for an async loader, that its compiled function then returns a promise of `{ output, exports }`, and how to port `not in` to native swig; the swig-jinja2 and swig-django READMEs lead with `renderFile` against an async loader.
* **Changed — development only.** The `globals` dev dependency moves to 17.x; `make lint` reports the same clean result.

Benchmarks
----------

[`benchmarks/render.js`](./benchmarks/render.js) measures sync-render throughput across five workload shapes against [Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks).

```bash
cd benchmarks && npm install && node render.js
```

In production-typical settings (autoescape on), `@rhinostone/swig` leads Nunjucks on all five workload shapes — from ~1.3× on simple variable output to 5.3–5.9× on iteration-heavy templates (median of 5 runs, 2026-10). See [`benchmarks/README.md`](./benchmarks/README.md) for the methodology, the full result table, and how to reproduce on your own hardware.

    npm install @rhinostone/swig-django

Documentation
-------------

User-facing documentation lives in the Gina Docusaurus site under the [Swig Template Engine](https://gina.io/docs/templating/swig) section, maintained in [gina-io/docs](https://github.com/gina-io/docs) at `docs/templating/swig/`. The JSDoc blocks in `lib/swig.js`, `lib/filters.js`, `lib/tags/`, and `packages/swig-core/lib/loaders/` remain the canonical source-of-truth for the public API and are mirrored into the Docusaurus pages.

Basic Example
-------------

### Template code

```html
<h1>{{ pagename|title }}</h1>
<ul>
{% for author in authors %}
    <li{% if loop.first %} class="first"{% endif %}>{{ author }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### node.js code

```js
var swig  = require('@rhinostone/swig');
var template = swig.compileFile('/absolute/path/to/template.html');
var output = template({
    pagename: 'awesome people',
    authors: ['Paul', 'Jim', 'Jane']
});
```

### Output

```html
<h1>Awesome People</h1>
<ul>
    <li class="first">Paul</li>
    <li>Jim</li>
    <li>Jane</li>
</ul>
```

For working example see [examples/basic](https://github.com/gina-io/swig/tree/master/examples/basic).

Migrating from `@rhinostone/swig@1.x`
-------------------------------------

`@rhinostone/swig@2.x` is **drop-in for `1.x` consumers** — `swig.compileFile`, `swig.renderFile`, `swig.setFilter`, `swig.setTag`, and the rest of the public API are unchanged. The internal carve into [@rhinostone/swig-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core) is transparent (test gate during the alpha cycle: byte-identical compiled output against the `1.x` test suite).

`2.0.0` also ships [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig), a sibling Twig-syntax frontend; `2.5.0` adds [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2) for Python Jinja2 syntax; and `2.7.0` adds [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django) for Django Template Language syntax. Switching is opt-in — your existing `@rhinostone/swig` install keeps working.

Migrating from Jinja2 or Django
-------------------------------

Swig is *inspired by* Jinja2 and Django, not a drop-in replacement. Common pitfalls when porting existing templates:

* **No `is` / `is not` / `not in` operators** — rewrite `{% if x is defined %}` as `{% if x !== undefined %}`, and `{% if x not in xs %}` for a list as `{% if xs.indexOf(x) === -1 %}` (`in` tests an object's keys or an array's indices, not membership).
* **Django `forloop.counter` → Swig `loop.index`** (Swig follows Jinja2 loop-variable naming).
* **`{{ super() }}` / `{{ block.super }}` → `{% parent %}`** — Swig uses a dedicated tag inside the overriding block.
* **Django filter args use a colon (`|date:"Y-m-d"`) — Swig uses parens (`|date("Y-m-d")`)**.
* **`{% with x=1 %}` → `{% set x = 1 %}`**, and no block-form `{% set %}…{% endset %}`.
* **No `{% from "f" import x %}` — use `{% import "f" as ns %}` + `ns.x` instead**.
* **Method calls require parens** — Django auto-invokes `x.get_absolute_url`; Swig needs `x.get_absolute_url()`.
* **Many Jinja2 filters are absent** — `truncate`, `tojson`, `round`, `int`, `float`, `map`, `select`, `batch`, `trim`, etc. (`default` **is** built in). Register missing ones via `swig.setFilter(name, fn)` — or use [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2), which ships 39 of them natively.

How it works
------------

Swig reads template files and translates them into cached JavaScript functions. The pipeline is: parse → emit IR → lower IR to JS source → `new Function(...)`. At render time, the compiled function runs against a context object to produce the output string.

In `2.x`, frontend parsers (native Swig syntax in [@rhinostone/swig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig), Twig syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig), Python Jinja2 syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2), Django Template Language syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django)) emit a shared intermediate representation. The backend in [@rhinostone/swig-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core) lowers IR to JS. New flavors plug in at the frontend without touching the runtime.

For strict-CSP targets the compile pipeline can be skipped entirely: AOT-compile templates with the CLI (`swig compile --recursive --register`) and execute the resulting bundle with the runtime-only build (`dist/swig.runtime.min.js`), which contains no parser and no `new Function`.
