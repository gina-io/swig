> **Multi-flavor template engine** for Node.js and browsers — native Swig syntax (Jinja2/Django-inspired), Twig syntax, Python Jinja2 syntax, and Django Template Language syntax via dedicated frontends sharing one IR backend. [gina-io/swig](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) started as a maintained continuation of the abandoned `paularmstrong/swig` (last released 2014) and is now a standalone project. Security and bug fixes ship here.

> **Part of the [Gina](https://github.com/gina-io/gina) ecosystem.** This is the built-in template engine for [Gina](https://gina.io) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gina)), a Node.js MVC framework with HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation.

Swig is a **Jinja2/Django-inspired** template engine for node.js and browsers. The syntax will feel familiar to Jinja2 and Django users, but Swig is **not drop-in compatible** with either — porting templates from an existing project requires a handful of changes. See the [Migration Guide](https://gina.io/docs/templating/swig/migration) for the full parity list and workaround patterns.

> **Coming from Twig?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig) instead — a dedicated Twig-syntax frontend with closer parity than working around incompatibilities here.

> **Coming from Python Jinja2?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2) — a dedicated Jinja2-syntax frontend (near-subset) with closer parity than porting to native Swig syntax here.

> **Coming from Django?** Install [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django) — a dedicated Django Template Language frontend that renders real Django templates, with far closer parity than native Swig syntax here.

Features
--------

* Available for node.js **and** major web browsers.
* **Strict-CSP browser runtime** — AOT-compile templates ahead of time (`swig compile --recursive --register`) and render them with the runtime-only bundle (`dist/swig.runtime.min.js`, ~24 KB) — no parser, no `new Function`, no `unsafe-eval` required.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) compatible.
* **Async template loading** — back the loader with S3 / Redis / HTTP / any callback API: set `loader.async = true` and pass a callback to `renderFile`, or to `compileFile` with `codegenMode: 'async'` in its options, whose compiled function returns a promise of `{ output, exports }`; `extends` / `include` / `import` resolve at render time, dynamic `{% extends %}` paths included.
* Object-Oriented template inheritance.
* Apply filters and transformations to output in your templates.
* **Security-hardened** — prototype-pollution vectors (`__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype`) blocked at parser, tag-side, and IR-emission layers; template-driven file reads outside the loader root rejected (CVE-2023-25345 directory traversal, patched in 2.7.1). Dedicated CVE regression suite in [`tests/regressions.test.js`](./tests/regressions.test.js).
* Automatically escapes all variable output (HTML by default; configurable per-call).
* Lots of iteration and conditionals supported.
* Robust without the bloat — a single runtime dependency ([`@rhinostone/swig-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core)).
* Extendable and customizable — register custom filters, tags, and loaders per-instance.

What's new in v2.9.13
---------------------

> **Behaviour changes.** On the async render path (`renderFile` with `loader.async`, `compileFile` with `codegenMode: 'async'`) compiled templates now stay in the instance's cache, as on the sync path: with `cache: 'memory'` (the default) or a custom cache an edited template is not picked up until `invalidateCache()` is called (a custom cache must drop the entry itself), and the first compile of a file fixes its compile options; `cache: false` keeps loading on every render. swig-django `add` no longer joins a string and a number: `{{ "a"|add:1 }}` gives an empty string, as Django does. swig-twig and swig-jinja2 `length` gives 0 for undefined, null and an empty string, where it gave an empty string. swig-twig `date` gives the current date for a missing value, null, an empty string and "now", as Twig does. A custom filter that calls `iterateFilter` gets an empty string back for an undefined or null input, so its own code no longer runs on undefined. An exception thrown by the `renderFile` callback on the async render path surfaces as an unhandled rejection, where the callback was called again with it. A template precompiled by an earlier release keeps the old reading of filter and call results at operands until it is compiled again.

* **Fixed — filter inputs, native swig.** A filter after a filter or a call that found nothing renders an empty string, so `{{ items|first|lower }}` over an empty list and `{{ f()|upper }}` with an undefined or null result no longer throw or print `[object Object]`, in outputs and in tag arguments. `first`, `last` and `replace` give an empty string for such an input, `length` gives 0, and `date` gives an empty string for a missing, null, empty or invalid value. `replace` reads a missing replacement as an empty string, and `replace` and `addslashes` take a number or a boolean; `replace` on an array or an object still fails.
* **Fixed — filter inputs, swig-twig.** The same chains render an empty string, and `first` and `last` give one for such an input. `date` follows Twig (see above), and a string that is no date gives an empty string. `replace` writes a replacement that is undefined or null as an empty string.
* **Fixed — filter inputs, swig-jinja2.** The same chains render an empty string. `truncate`, `indent`, `center`, `urlencode`, `striptags` and `title` read such an input as an empty string, `wordcount` gives 0, and `date` gives an empty string for a missing, null, empty or invalid value.
* **Fixed — filter inputs, swig-django.** The string filters read a None value, and a variable that fails to resolve where Django reads it as None (`if`, `for`, `firstof`), as the text None, as Django does: `{{ x|upper }}` with x None renders NONE, and `{% if user.role|lower == "admin" %}` over a missing role takes the else branch instead of throwing. `escape`, `escapejs` and `safe` keep the empty string of `{{ x }}`. `date` gives an empty string for a string that is no date, and `floatformat` with an invalid argument for None.
* **Fixed — filter and call results at operands.** A result that is undefined or null reads as an empty string at an arithmetic, `~` or unary operand, as a variable holding one does, in swig, swig-twig and swig-jinja2: `{{ 1 + f() }}` renders 1 and `{{ f() ~ "a" }}` renders a. The operands of swig-jinja2's `**` are not covered.
* **Fixed — the async render path's cache.** A template, an included partial and an extends parent are loaded and compiled once, where a 200-item loop with one include called the loader 201 times per render.
* **Fixed — the `renderFile` callback.** On the async render path it is called once when it throws.
* **Fixed — swig-django `add`.** It gives an empty string for operands Python cannot add, as Django does: a string and a number, a list or a mapping with anything but a list, and two mappings, and for a None or missing operand. Two lists of one number each now join instead of adding as numbers.

Benchmarks
----------

[`benchmarks/render.js`](./benchmarks/render.js) measures sync-render throughput across five workload shapes against [Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks).

```bash
cd benchmarks && npm install && node render.js
```

In production-typical settings (autoescape on), `@rhinostone/swig` leads Nunjucks on all five workload shapes — narrowly on simple variable output (1.06×), and by 3.7–5.0× on iteration-heavy templates (median of 5 runs, 2026-10-29, `2.9.11`). See [`benchmarks/README.md`](./benchmarks/README.md) for the methodology, the full result table, and how to reproduce on your own hardware.

Documentation
-------------

User-facing documentation lives in the Gina Docusaurus site under the [Swig Template Engine](https://gina.io/docs/templating/swig) section, maintained in [gina-io/docs](https://github.com/gina-io/docs) at `docs/templating/swig/`. The JSDoc blocks in `lib/swig.js`, `lib/filters.js`, `lib/tags/`, and `packages/swig-core/lib/loaders/` remain the canonical source-of-truth for the public API and are mirrored into the Docusaurus pages.

Basic Example
-------------

### Template code

```html
<h1>{{ pagename|title }}</h1>
<ul>
{% for author in authors %}
    <li{% if loop.first %} class="first"{% endif %}>{{ author }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### node.js code

```js
var swig  = require('@rhinostone/swig');
var template = swig.compileFile('/absolute/path/to/template.html');
var output = template({
    pagename: 'awesome people',
    authors: ['Paul', 'Jim', 'Jane']
});
```

### Output

```html
<h1>Awesome People</h1>
<ul>
    <li class="first">Paul</li>
    <li>Jim</li>
    <li>Jane</li>
</ul>
```

For working example see [examples/basic](https://github.com/gina-io/swig/tree/master/examples/basic).

Migrating from `@rhinostone/swig@1.x`
-------------------------------------

`@rhinostone/swig@2.x` is **drop-in for `1.x` consumers** — `swig.compileFile`, `swig.renderFile`, `swig.setFilter`, `swig.setTag`, and the rest of the public API are unchanged. The internal carve into [@rhinostone/swig-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core) is transparent (test gate during the alpha cycle: byte-identical compiled output against the `1.x` test suite).

`2.0.0` also ships [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig), a sibling Twig-syntax frontend; `2.5.0` adds [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2) for Python Jinja2 syntax; and `2.7.0` adds [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django) for Django Template Language syntax. Switching is opt-in — your existing `@rhinostone/swig` install keeps working.

Migrating from Jinja2 or Django
-------------------------------

Swig is *inspired by* Jinja2 and Django, not a drop-in replacement. Common pitfalls when porting existing templates:

* **No `is` / `is not` / `not in` operators** — rewrite `{% if x is defined %}` as `{% if x !== undefined %}`, and `{% if x not in xs %}` for a list as `{% if xs.indexOf(x) === -1 %}` (`in` tests an object's keys or an array's indices, not membership).
* **Django `forloop.counter` → Swig `loop.index`** (Swig follows Jinja2 loop-variable naming).
* **`{{ super() }}` / `{{ block.super }}` → `{% parent %}`** — Swig uses a dedicated tag inside the overriding block.
* **Django filter args use a colon (`|date:"Y-m-d"`) — Swig uses parens (`|date("Y-m-d")`)**.
* **`{% with x=1 %}` → `{% set x = 1 %}`**, and no block-form `{% set %}…{% endset %}`.
* **No `{% from "f" import x %}` — use `{% import "f" as ns %}` + `ns.x` instead**.
* **Method calls require parens** — Django auto-invokes `x.get_absolute_url`; Swig needs `x.get_absolute_url()`.
* **Many Jinja2 filters are absent** — `truncate`, `tojson`, `round`, `int`, `float`, `map`, `select`, `batch`, `trim`, etc. (`default` **is** built in). Register missing ones via `swig.setFilter(name, fn)` — or use [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2), which ships 39 of them natively.

How it works
------------

Swig reads template files and translates them into cached JavaScript functions. The pipeline is: parse → emit IR → lower IR to JS source → `new Function(...)`. At render time, the compiled function runs against a context object to produce the output string.

In `2.x`, frontend parsers (native Swig syntax in [@rhinostone/swig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig), Twig syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-twig), Python Jinja2 syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-jinja2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-jinja2), Django Template Language syntax in [@rhinostone/swig-django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-django)) emit a shared intermediate representation. The backend in [@rhinostone/swig-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhinostone/swig-core) lowers IR to JS. New flavors plug in at the frontend without touching the runtime.

For strict-CSP targets the compile pipeline can be skipped entirely: AOT-compile templates with the CLI (`swig compile --recursive --register`) and execute the resulting bundle with the runtime-only build (`dist/swig.runtime.min.js`), which contains no parser and no `new Function`.
